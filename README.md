# 📄 Document Scanner with OCR

A lightweight, end-to-end document scanner built using **OpenCV** and **Tesseract OCR**. This project detects documents (like receipts, paper, forms), extracts the perspective-warped version, enhances it, and finally uses **OCR** to extract the textual content from the image.

## 🧠 ML & CV Concepts

### Computer Vision Concepts:
- **Image Preprocessing** – Grayscale, Gaussian Blur, Thresholding
- **Contour Detection** – Finding document edges
- **Perspective Transformation** – Warping document into a flat scan
- **Morphological Operations** – Dilation to enhance edge detection
- **Canny Edge Detection** – Identifying boundaries

### OCR (Optical Character Recognition):
- Utilizes **Tesseract** to recognize text in scanned, binarized images.

## ⚙️ Working Pipeline

A[Original Image] --> B[Grayscale + Blur]
B --> C[Adaptive Threshold + Dilation]
C --> D[Canny Edge Detection]
D --> E[Find Contours]
E --> F[Detect 4-Point Document]
F --> G[Perspective Transform]
G --> H[Enhance / Binarize]
H --> I[OCR with Tesseract]
```
## Step-by-Step Breakdown:

### 1. Load Image
The image is loaded into the system for processing.

### 2. Grayscale & Blur
The image is first converted to grayscale to simplify processing, then Gaussian blur is applied to reduce noise and help with edge detection.

### 3. Adaptive Threshold & Dilation
We apply adaptive thresholding to convert the image into a binary (black and white) format and use dilation to emphasize edges.

### 4. Canny Edge Detection
Canny edge detection is applied to identify the boundaries within the image.

### 5. Find Contours
Contours of the image are detected, and the largest 4-point contour (representing the document edges) is identified.

### 6. Detect 4-Point Document
If a clean 4-point contour is detected, it is used as the boundary for the document. Otherwise, we allow the user to manually select the 4 points.

### 7. Perspective Transformation
Once the 4 points are detected, we warp the document into a top-down view to simulate a scan.

### 8. Enhance & Binarize
After the transformation, the image is enhanced and binarized to improve the contrast for OCR recognition.

### 9. OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
Finally, we use Tesseract OCR to extract text from the binarized document.

### ✨ Features

**Edge Detection** – Detects the edges of the document using Canny edge detection.

**Perspective Transformation** – Warps the document to create a top-down scan.

**OCR Integration** – Extracts text from scanned documents using Tesseract OCR.

**Output Options** – Supports exporting the result as a JPG, PNG, PDF, or TXT file.

**Manual Mode** – Allows users to manually select the corners of the document if automatic detection fails.
